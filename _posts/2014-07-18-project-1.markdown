title: Atomistic spin dynamics
---
Magnetic properties underpin a multitude of state-of-the-art technologies ranging from sensors to memory storage devices. At the nanoscale, the atomic species and arrangement can greatly affect the overall magnetization dynamics. Atomistic spin dynamics (ASD) employs Heisenberg-like Hamiltonians tailored to reproduce the magnetic properties of a given material. The possibility of estimating the required parameters from DFT effectively enables to bridge quantum mechanical information to lengths up to tens of nanometers.

The ASD Hamiltonian can also be adopted to include torques calculated from first principles. Extensive details on how the mapping is performed and example calculations can be found <a href="http://www.tara.tcd.ie/handle/2262/91664">here</a>.

Although most materials can be represented through an Heisenberg Hamiltonian, in many cases the need of many parameters can be a strong deterrent. For example, magnetic moments at Pt sites in L1<sub>0</sub>FePt is heavily dependent on the orientation of moments at Fe sites. In principle, **CHECK** is needed. To overcome this difficulty we extended the ASD model to accomodate for dynamical spin length variations. This enables <b>COMPLETE</b>.
