title: Many-body Green's functions
---
A major portion of the electronic structure calculations performed today rely on the solution of the Schroedinger equation in the independent particle picture (e.g. KS-DFT). Nevertheless, several phenomena critically depend on either higher levels of correlation or on thermodynamical conditions that elude the capabilities of DFT approaches. Green's functions (GFs) are the ideal mathematical tool to extend DFT because:

1. given the GF of an electronic system any related property can be calculated;
2. a perturbation theory can be naturally defined, and the influence of additional factors (e.g. phonons, higher order correlations, ...) can be readily included given the relevant **self-energy** ;
3. there can be tailored to include couplings to reservoirs and non-adiabatic interactions with the environment.

Considering electron-hole pairs is essential to correctly predict the optical response of materials as simple as bulk Si. This can be done by solving the stationary equation of motion for the 2-particle (4-body) GF, known as the Bether-Salpeter equation (BSE). I contributed to the implementation of such methodology in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.03175.pdf">SIMPLE</a> code, now part of the Quantum Espresso suite of DFT codes.
