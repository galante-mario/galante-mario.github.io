title: Spin currents
---
The manipulation of atomic magnetic moments has proven instrumental for the realisation of efficient miniaturized (spin-)electronic devices. The generation of spin-polarized currents and their interaction with molecular or multilayered nanostructures is dictated by the rearrangement of the electronic populations when a bias voltage is applied. This can be done through a quantum transport calculation through Green's function techniques.
