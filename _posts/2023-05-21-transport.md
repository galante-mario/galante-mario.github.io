title: Spin currents
---
Exploiting the spin polarization of electronic currents plays a pivotal role in the development of miniaturized and energy efficient electronic and magnetic storage devices. For example, giant magnetoresistance (GMR) underpins the working principle of modern read heads of hard disk drives, while effects such as the Spin Hall and the Spin Seebeck Effects are all attractive candidates to generate spin polarization. The main challenges are to maximize the degree of spin polarization and to unveil the interplay between the current flow and the underlying atomic magnetic moments.

<h3 class="post-section">Spin selectivity</h3>
The use of a material stack or a molecule that filters one spin state is the most spatially efficient way to produce spin polarized currents. Tunnelling barriers are eccellent candidates, although they are effective only for specific material combinations (e.g. Fe/MgO) and require the growth of very clean interfaces.
Recently, it was shown that molecular chirality can also be used to filter spin states. The efficient exploitation of chirality induced spin selectivity (CISS) could therefore be the key to the development of efficient molecular electronic devices. Several aspects of such phenomenon are still largely unknown.

<h3 class="post-section">Spin transfer torques</h3>
The flow of an electric current with spin polarization misaligned with the orientation of the local magnetic moments results in the progressive transfer of angular momentum between current and magnetic layer. In other terms, the spin of conduction electrons rotates while traversing the magnetic slab, therefore exhorting an effective torque on the local magnetic moments. The latter is known as spin transfer torque (STT)
