title: Dynamical effects in (bio)polymers
---
Polymer dynamics is at the basis of many phenomena of interest from modern science, ranging from biological processes such as protein folding to the systhesis and stabilization of polymer melts for engineering applications. The large length and time scales of such systems, combined with the high level of resolution required, pose a formidable challenge for the molecular modelling community. An additional complication is the presence long range interactions which can be of relatively low magnitude yet essential to control the cooperativity and guide the conformational changes in the system.
My focus is in particular on how many-body dispersion interactions can affect the dynamics of large polymeric systems. Early work focused on model polymers, showing that MBD yields an improved conformational search <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.5.L012028" class="link-pdf">PhysRevResearch.5.L012028</a>. We are also working at analyzing the structural phase transitions from a thermodynamical perspective.
More undergoing work is centered on ultra-heavy-weight-polyethelene and on realistic biopolymers.
