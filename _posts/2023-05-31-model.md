title: Coarse graining in quantum mechanics
---
Quantum mechanical phenomena are at the fundations of any macroscopic observable. The elevated complexity together with the astronomical number of degrees of freedom involved makes impossible its direct application to nanoscale or microscale systems. The investigation of quantum mechanical effects at large length and time scales is one of the most relevant and formidable challenges of modern times. I have a keen interest in methods that allow to single out the key factors of the quantum world that are determinant to control the behaviour of microscopic and macroscopic objects.

### Optical spectra

The inclusion of electron-hole bound states, known as excitons, is essential to correctly estimate the optical response of semiconductors as simple as silicon. This requires the solution of the Bethe-Salpeter equation, which is generally fairly computational expensive to evaluate. I took part to the implementation of a methodology that employs an optimal basis set approach to express excitonic states through a reduced number of degrees of freedom.

### Atomistic spin dynamics
Magnetization dynamics underpins a multitude of modern technologies, ranging from sensing devices to memory storage. The latter can be highly sensitive to the local atomic structure, yet only the behaviour of the global magnetisation matters for most materials relevant of applications. In such cases, the magnetic moments localised at atomic sites can be represented as a classical (Heisenberg-like) spin vectors, and their dynamics can be described through the Landau-Lischfitz-Gilbert equation. I contributed to the formuation of a methodology to use first principles calculations to parameterise atomistic spin models for current-driven spin dynamics in ferromagnetics and anti-ferromagnetics materials.

#### Van der Waals dispersio and dynamical effects
Van der Waals dispersion interactions provide a relatively small energetic contribution, yet can be essential to guide the global dynamics of nanoscale systems. However, such effects become relevant only for systems of 60+ atoms, and their importance for biological systems made of ~10k atoms is of troublesome determination given the high number of degrees of freedom and the consequent high computatioanl cost. I am involved in a project that aims for a continuum description of MBD interactions for polymers, which should be able to shed light on the influence of MBD in polymer melts.
